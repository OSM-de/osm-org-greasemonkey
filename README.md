# Additional links for openstreetmap.org using [Greasemonkey](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey)

This script adds links to OSM Deep History for Nodes, Ways and Relations, OSMCha for Changesets as well as KartaView and Mapillary buttons 
in the primary navigation when displayed on openstreetmap.org.
